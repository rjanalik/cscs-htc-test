# cscs-htc-test

I am testing High Throughput Computing (HTC) workflows and tools. In this repository I am preparing simple hello-world like examples that are implemented using different HTC schedulers. I want to compare the schedulers to decide which ones we will support and recommend on SLURM clusters at CSCS.

My goal is to test at least these tools, but possibly also others:
- HyperQueue
- Flux
- GREASY
